# GraphQL Client Sync with Box and Dice

This example shows how to use the Box and Dice GraphQL API to sync data. It uses no GraphQL libraries or ORMsâ€”just a minimal, demonstration-only approach, not intended for production.

Once syncing is complete, open the data.db file in your favorite SQLite browser or editor to explore the downloaded data.

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update it with your values.
2. Ensure Docker is installed.
3. From the command line:
```
   $ docker compose build
   $ docker compose up
```
